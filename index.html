        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="myDescription">
          I am a junior game developer with 1+ years of experience in Unity. I
          am an ambitious and organized person. I love to climb to mountains,
          spend time in nature and read books.

          <h3>3D Virus Simulation Application</h3>
          <p>
            With this application, a user can configure a new virus or can
            choose from four default viruses. Once the simulation begins, the
            user can visualize a city that behaves as realistically as possible.
            At the same time, the user can see in the upper left part of the
            screen different information related to the spread rate,
            hospitalization rate and mortality rate of the introduced virus and
            can apply different restrictions to see how the virus evolves. The
            people on the stage behave as close to reality as possible, they go
            to work, to restaurants, to the hospital or at home depending on
            four parameters: Money, Food, Health and Energy. Human behavior was
            created using Behavior Tree. The decisions that the characters make
            are based on a score, which has a value between 0 and 1, where it
            means that the action will not happen, and 1 means that the action
            must happen. This application aims to clarify the evolution of a
            virus to humans using a simulation instead of interpreting
            statistical data

          <p>
            BookVision is an application for readers. In this application, the
            user can add the book he is reading or wants to buy it. Information
            about the book can be retained, such as: the name of the book, the
            author, a short description, the number of pages, the publisher. The
            user can view the books read, owned, desired or currently reading.
            This application can be used even when there is no internet
            connection. BookVision is an application that comes to the aid of
            users who want to know what books they have read or what books they
            want.
